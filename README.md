# Universal Intro Skipper

######  This is a small tool that automatically clicks the skip intro and the play next episode button.

## Why?
I got tired of having to tab out of my current window if I was watching a show on my second monitor. 
Silly yes, but helpful.




## Features
- Automatically skips intros on supported streaming platforms.
- Automatically plays the next episode in a series.
- Tiny and very simple gui to toggle the functionality on and off.
- Supports for now Disney+, other platforms will follow.
